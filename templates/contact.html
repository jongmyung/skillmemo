Hello!
I am Jong, creator of SkillMemo. 

    SkillMemo was originally created for people who want to learn coding. While developing I kept adding more features not even organize their skill knowledge but also share their outstanding contents. 
    
    If you are a content creator, teacher/ instructor or personal blogger and as users keep growing you will find more potential of SkillMemo. Definitely you will love it. 
    
    If you have any questions, suggestions, have to report a bad user or have some technical issues please feel free to let me know. I will fix it! :)
